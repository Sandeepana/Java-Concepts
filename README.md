Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
